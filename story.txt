As I endured the accelerating timeline, the roar of the machine shaking every cell in my body,
I couldnâ€™t let a sense of panic wash over me in theory, this machine managed to shoot the
curtain of time, and it allowed me to so cross the vast expanse of human history in the blink
of an eye ? What if I was in the past, lost forever in the history of time? Questions swirled
through my mind, but I pushed them aside, my heart pounding with joy. I was about to embark o
n the journey of a lifetime, and nothing was going to stop me.
